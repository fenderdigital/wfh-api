# WFH API 
### What is this?
At [pebble {code}][1] we have a remote working policy, so to help find out who is working where we created a system to show the list of workers and their status. For more details see our [blogpost](http://pebblecode.com/blog/november-wfh-slack/) Do you also work in a remote workplace? If you're using Slack you can easily deploy your own, and even start building things with the api. We have two services connecting to our api, one to send a summary email every weekday at 10am and another that pulls sickness and holiday information from our HR system.

This repo contains a node implementation of the pebble {code}the wfh api, more details see blogpost: http://pebblecode.com/blog/november-wfh-slack/


###functionality
This adds the following slash commands in slack:
`/wfo`
`/wfh`

### Slack slash command parameters
message: `/wfh message:I'll be at home in my pants` or `/wfo message:I'll be at the stand up desk today`
default: `/wfh default:wfo` this allows your default location to be either `wfh,wfo` 

The first time a user does /wfh, /wfo opts the user into the system. After that they will be shown in the api response /workers.

You will need to configure Slack slash [commands](https://slack.com/services#service_16).
use `/wfh` and `/wfo` to point to: `/webhooks/slack`, use a post request and add the tokens to the apps environment variables

For a nicer couch db ui install: `npm i -g fauxton` then in a new shell run `fauxton`

`npm i && npm i -g nodemon`
start server locally
`npm run dev`

When NODE_ENV === 'development' connection will be made with localhost couchdb.

###Integrations
The api has full CRUD functionality, see the docs for more details. So this is open for your own integrations. We've used this to integrate with [Tribe HR](https://github.com/pebblecode/tribehr-holiday-fetcher), [send Emails at 10am](https://github.com/pebblecode/wfh-email-cron) or [display on a TV in the office](https://github.com/pebblecode/wfh-frontend).
